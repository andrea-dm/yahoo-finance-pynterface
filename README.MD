# Yahoo Finance Python Interface


**yahoo-finance-pynterface** is a Python package that provide a new interface to the Yahoo Finance API.

Check the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/andrea-dm/yahoo-finance-pynterface/wiki) for a quick reference.


### Motivation

 [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) is by far the most popular (_and free!_) resource for financial data. 

Many packages have been distributed to provide access to such a resource in the recent past.
However, most of such projects were aiming at filling the gap that the changes made in May, 2017 by the Yahoo Team left behind.

**yahoo-finance-pynterface** has been intended to provide a completely new interface to Yahoo Finance,
and it is meant to offer effective methods to interact with its API. 


### About

**yahoo-finance-pynterface** is based on [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
Hence, most of the data retrieved are returned as _pandas_.**DataFrame** object. 

Even if a stable release is available, the project has yet to be considered "complete" and many other features has yet to come!
